# 📻 BlueTune

**BlueTune** is a privacy-focused, client-side Progressive Web App (PWA) that transforms your BlueSky social feed into a hands-free, radio-like experience. Built specifically to run on hardened mobile environments (like GrapheneOS or PixelOS), it bypasses traditional tracking by running entirely in your browser.

## 🚀 Features
* **Audio Feed:** Converts BlueSky posts to speech using local Text-to-Speech (TTS).
* **Topic Tuner:** "Tune in" to specific keywords or "Tune out" to return to your main timeline.
* **Smart Pacing:** Adjusts playback duration based on the length of the post.
* **Edge-Ready Logic:** Uses a "Heartbeat" bridge to ensure the AT Protocol library is securely anchored in memory before execution.
* **Speed Control:** Adjustable playback speed for rapid information digestion.
* **Stop/Mute:** Instant audio termination for on-demand silence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Protocol:** [AT Protocol (@atproto/api)](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto)
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
* **Security:** Content-Security-Policy (CSP) optimized for mobile browser hardening.
